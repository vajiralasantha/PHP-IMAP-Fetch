# PHP IMAP Fetch

PHP IMAP Fetch is a library for reading email and attachments, primarily using the POP 
and IMAP protocols.


## Installing

 > N.b. A note on Ubuntu 14.04 (probably other Debian-based / Apt managed
 > systems), the install of php5-imap does not enable the extension for CLI
 > (possibly others as well), which can cause composer to report fetch
 > requires `ext-imap`
 
 ```sh
sudo ln -s /etc/php5/mods-available/imap.ini /etc/php5/cli/conf.d/30-imap.ini
 ```

### Composer

Installing Fetch can be done through a variety of methods, although Composer
is recommended.

```
"require": {
  "vajiral/php-imap-fetch": "*"
}
```

## Sample Usage

This is just a simple code to show how to access messages by using Fetch. It
uses Fetch own autoload, but it can (and should be, if applicable) replaced
with the one generated by composer.

```php
use BigV\ImapFetch\Server;
use BigV\ImapFetch\Message;

$server = new Server('imap.example.com', 993);
$server->setAuthentication('username', 'password');

/** @var Message[] $message */
$messages = $server->getMessages();

foreach ($messages as $message) {
    echo "Subject: {$message->getSubject()}", PHP_EOL;
    echo "Body: {$message->getMessageBody()}", PHP_EOL;
}
```
